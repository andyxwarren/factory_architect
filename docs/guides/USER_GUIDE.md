## How Does It Work? (The Simple Version)

Imagine you have two expert assistants working together:

### ðŸ§® **The Mathematics Expert (Math Engine)**
- Knows exactly how to create every type of calculation
- Understands what makes problems harder or easier
- Can adjust difficulty perfectly for each year group
- Works with pure numbers and mathematical concepts

### ðŸ“– **The Story Writer (Story Engine)** 
- Takes those mathematical calculations
- Wraps them in real-world scenarios children understand
- Makes abstract maths feel practical and relevant
- Uses familiar contexts like shopping, sharing, and measuring

**Result**: Instead of seeing "47 + 23 = ?", a child might see "Sarah has Â£47 in her savings account. Her grandmother gives her Â£23 more. How much does Sarah have now?"

## The Two-Engine Architecture Explained

### Why Two Separate Engines?

This separation is powerful because:

**Math Engine Benefits:**
- Creates mathematically perfect problems every time
- Ensures proper difficulty progression
- Maintains educational accuracy
- Can be used with any story context

**Story Engine Benefits:**  
- Makes maths feel relevant and engaging
- Uses age-appropriate language and scenarios
- Can present the same calculation in multiple ways
- Adapts to different cultural contexts

**Example**: The calculation "24 Ã· 6 = 4" could become:
- Money context: "24 sweets cost Â£6. How much does each sweet cost?"
- Sharing context: "24 children need to form 6 equal groups. How many children in each group?"
- Measurement context: "A 24-metre rope is cut into 6 equal pieces. How long is each piece?"
