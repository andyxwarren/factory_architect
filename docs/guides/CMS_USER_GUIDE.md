1. **Difficulty Parameters** - How many mathematical configurations you have
   - Example: "116 configuration records"
   - Click to manage difficulty settings

2. **Characters** - Names used in story problems
   - Example: "33 available characters"
   - These are people who appear in word problems

3. **Items** - Objects with prices for shopping scenarios
   - Example: "42 items with pricing"
   - Things like apples, notebooks, footballs

4. **Scenario Templates** - Story structures
   - Example: "19 story templates"
   - Reusable sentence patterns for questions

5. **Curated Mappings** - Connections between models and formats
   - Example: "188 Model‚ÜíFormat‚ÜíTheme mappings"
   - Controls which question types appear for which math operations

6. **Generated Questions** - Questions created by the system
   - Example: "1 generated question (0 approved)"
   - Shows total and how many are approved

### Quick Actions

Three shortcut buttons for common tasks:

- **Generate New Questions** - Create questions immediately
- **Create New Mapping** - Set up new format/theme combinations
- **Review Questions** - Go to approval queue

---

## Characters Management

**Location**: `/admin/characters`

### What Are Characters?

Characters are people who appear in your math word problems. For example:
- "Sarah has 5 apples..."
- "Jack bought 3 notebooks..."
- "Emma saved ¬£10..."

### Viewing Characters

The Characters page shows a table with:
- **Name** - The character's name (e.g., "Alex", "Emma")
- **Gender** - Neutral, Male, or Female (for pronoun usage)
- **Cultural Context** - Geographic/cultural setting (e.g., "UK", "US")
- **Status** - Active (green) or Inactive (gray)

### Search Function

At the top, there's a search box:
- Type any text to filter characters
- Searches across name, gender, and cultural context
- Click the X to clear your search

### Adding a New Character

1. Click the blue **"Add Character"** button (top right)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name** - Enter a first name (required)
   - **Gender** - Choose Neutral, Male, or Female
   - **Cultural Context** - Enter region (e.g., "UK")
   - **Active checkbox** - Checked = available for questions
3. Click **"Create"**

### Editing a Character

1. Find the character in the table
2. Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) on the right
3. Update the fields
4. Click **"Update"**

### Deleting a Character

1. Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) on the right
2. Confirm you want to delete
3. The character is permanently removed

### Toggle Active/Inactive

Click the green "Active" or gray "Inactive" badge to quickly enable/disable a character without editing.

**Pro Tip**: Keep characters inactive if you're not ready to use them yet. This prevents them from appearing in questions.

---

## Items Management

**Location**: `/admin/items`

### What Are Items?

Items are objects with prices used in shopping scenarios. Examples:
- "A notebook costs ¬£2.50"
- "Apples are ¬£1.20 per bag"
- "A football costs ¬£15.99"

### Viewing Items

The Items page shows:
- **Name** - Item name (e.g., "Apple", "Notebook")
- **Category** - Type of item (Food, Toys, School Supplies, etc.)
- **Themes** - Blue badges showing which scenarios this item fits
- **Price Range** - Min, Typical, and Max prices in pounds (¬£)
- **Status** - Active or Inactive

### Search Function

Search across item names, categories, and themes. Example searches:
- "apple" - finds all apple-related items
- "school" - finds all school supplies
- "shopping" - finds all items tagged with SHOPPING theme

### Adding a New Item

1. Click **"Add Item"** (top right)
2. Fill in the form:

   **Name** (required)
   - Enter the item name (e.g., "Football")

   **Category** (required)
   - Choose from dropdown:
     - Food, Toys, School Supplies, Sports Equipment
     - Clothing, Electronics, Books, Household, Other

   **Themes** (required - at least one)
   - Click theme badges to select:
     - SHOPPING, SCHOOL, SPORTS, COOKING, POCKET_MONEY
     - TRANSPORT, COLLECTIONS, NATURE, HOUSEHOLD, CELEBRATIONS
   - Selected themes turn blue
   - Click again to deselect (X appears)

   **Prices** (required - in pounds ¬£)
   - **Min Price** - Lowest realistic price (e.g., 0.99)
   - **Typical Price** - Most common price (e.g., 2.50)
   - **Max Price** - Highest realistic price (e.g., 5.00)
   - System validates: min ‚â§ typical ‚â§ max

   **Active checkbox**
   - Checked = can appear in questions

3. Click **"Create"**

### Understanding Themes

Themes control which scenarios an item appears in:
- **SHOPPING** - General shopping trips
- **SCHOOL** - School-related contexts
- **POCKET_MONEY** - Allowance and savings
- **COOKING** - Recipes and food prep

An item can have multiple themes. For example, "Apple" might have:
- SHOPPING (buy at store)
- COOKING (use in recipe)
- SCHOOL (snack at school)

### Price Range Best Practices

Set realistic prices for your region:
- Research actual UK prices if targeting UK curriculum
- Min Price: Sale/discount price
- Typical Price: Normal everyday price
- Max Price: Premium/specialty version

**Example: Notebook**
- Min: ¬£0.50 (basic notebook on sale)
- Typical: ¬£2.00 (standard notebook)
- Max: ¬£5.00 (premium/specialty notebook)

## Difficulty Parameters

**Location**: `/admin/difficulty-parameters`

### What Are Difficulty Parameters?

These are the mathematical configurations that control how hard questions are. Each record defines the numbers and rules for a specific difficulty level.

For example, "ADDITION Year 1" might use:
```json
{
  "min": 1,
  "max": 10,
  "count": 2
}
```
This means: Add 2 numbers between 1 and 10.

### Viewing Parameters

The table shows:
- **Model ID** - Math operation (ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, etc.)
- **Difficulty Level** - Level code (e.g., "1", "2.1", "3.4")
- **Year Level** - UK curriculum year (1-6)
- **Parameters** - Click "View JSON" to see the configuration

### Expand/Collapse All Button

At the top right, you'll see:
- **"Expand All"** - Opens all JSON previews at once
- **"Collapse All"** - Closes all JSON previews

This is helpful when you want to scan through many configurations quickly.

### Filtering

Use the dropdown filters to narrow down what you see:
- **Model** - Show only ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, etc.
- **Year Level** - Show only Year 1, Year 2, etc.

Filters combine - you can select both to see "ADDITION for Year 3" only.

### Viewing JSON Parameters

Each row has a "View JSON" / "Hide JSON" button. Click it to see the raw configuration data.

**Example JSON for ADDITION**:
```json
{
  "min": 1,
  "max": 20,
  "count": 3,
  "allow_negatives": false
}
```

**What the fields mean**:
- `min` - Smallest number to use
- `max` - Largest number to use
- `count` - How many numbers to add together
- `allow_negatives` - Can results be negative?

Different models have different fields. MULTIPLICATION might have:
```json
{
  "multiplicand_min": 2,
  "multiplicand_max": 10,
  "multiplier_min": 2,
  "multiplier_max": 5,
  "include_decimal": false
}
```

### Adding a New Parameter

1. Click **"Add Parameter"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Model ID** - Choose the math operation
   - **Difficulty Level** - Enter level code (e.g., "3.2")
   - **Year Level** - Enter year (1-6)
   - **Parameters (JSON)** - Enter the configuration
3. Click **"Create"**

**JSON Editor Tips**:
- The editor validates your JSON in real-time
- Invalid JSON shows a red error message
- Use proper JSON format with quotes and commas
- Refer to existing parameters for examples

### Editing Parameters

1. Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è)
2. Modify the JSON
3. Click **"Update"**

**Warning**: Changing parameters affects all future questions generated at that difficulty level. Test thoroughly after changes.

### Difficulty Level Codes

The system supports two formats:

**Simple Format**: Just a number
- "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"
- Maps directly to UK curriculum years

**Sub-Level Format**: X.Y where X = year, Y = sub-level
- "3.1" = Year 3, Introductory
- "3.2" = Year 3, Developing
- "3.3" = Year 3, Standard
- "3.4" = Year 3, Advanced

Sub-levels give you fine-grained control over difficulty progression.

## Scenario Templates

**Location**: `/admin/scenario-templates`

### What Are Scenario Templates?

Templates are fill-in-the-blank sentence patterns that turn math into stories. For example:

**Template**:
```
{character} went to the {location} and bought {item} for {price}.
```

**Becomes**:
```
Sarah went to the shop and bought a notebook for ¬£2.50.
```

### Viewing Templates

The table shows:
- **Theme** - Context type (SHOPPING, SCHOOL, SPORTS, etc.)
- **Format** - Question type (DIRECT_CALCULATION, COMPARISON, etc.)
- **Template Text** - The sentence pattern (truncated if long)
- **Placeholders** - Variables in the template (shows first 3)
- **Status** - Active or Inactive

### Filtering

Use dropdowns to filter by:
- **Theme** - Show only SHOPPING templates
- **Format** - Show only COMPARISON templates

### Previewing Templates

Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) to see:
- Full template text
- All placeholders
- Example with sample data filled in

This helps you visualize how the template will look in actual questions.

### Adding a New Template

1. Click **"Add Template"**
2. Fill in the form:

   **Theme** (required)
   - Choose from dropdown: SHOPPING, SCHOOL, SPORTS, etc.

   **Format** (required)
   - Choose question type:
     - DIRECT_CALCULATION - "What is 5 + 3?"
     - COMPARISON - "Which costs more?"
     - ESTIMATION - "About how many?"
     - VALIDATION - "Is this correct?"
     - MULTI_STEP - Multiple calculations needed
     - MISSING_VALUE - "Find the unknown"
     - ORDERING - "Put in order"
     - PATTERN_RECOGNITION - "What comes next?"

   **Template Text** (required)
   - Write your sentence pattern
   - Use curly braces for variables: `{character}`, `{item}`, `{price}`

   **Placeholders**
   - Type a placeholder name and click "Add"
   - These must match the `{braces}` in your template
   - Click X on a tag to remove it

   **Active checkbox**
   - Checked = can be used for questions

3. Click **"Create"**

### Template Writing Guidelines

**Good Template**:
```
{character} bought {count} {item}s at {price} each. How much did {character} spend in total?
```

**Placeholders**: character, count, item, price

**Why it's good**:
- Clear question structure
- Multiple placeholders for variety
- Natural language flow
- Appropriate for the format

**Poor Template**:
```
Person buys things. How much?
```

**Why it's poor**:
- Too vague
- No placeholders (no variety)
- Unclear question
- Not engaging

### Common Placeholders

Standard placeholders you should use:
- `{character}` - Person's name
- `{item}` - Object name
- `{price}` - Cost in pounds
- `{quantity}` or `{count}` - How many
- `{location}` - Where (shop, school, park)
- `{total}` - Sum amount
- `{change}` - Money returned

**Pro Tip**: Use consistent placeholder names across templates. This makes the system work better.

### Format-Specific Templates

Different formats need different template structures:

**DIRECT_CALCULATION**:
- State the problem clearly
- Ask for a specific calculation
- Example: "{character} has {value1} and gets {value2} more. How many in total?"

**COMPARISON**:
- Present two options
- Ask which is better/more/less
- Example: "{item1} costs {price1} and {item2} costs {price2}. Which is cheaper?"

**VALIDATION**:
- Show a statement
- Ask if it's correct
- Example: "{character} says {value1} + {value2} = {result}. Is this correct?"

---

## Curated Mappings

**Location**: `/admin/curated-mappings`

### What Are Curated Mappings?

Mappings connect three things:
1. **Math Model** - The operation (ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, etc.)
2. **Format** - The question type (DIRECT_CALCULATION, COMPARISON, etc.)
3. **Theme** - The story context (SHOPPING, SCHOOL, etc.)

They also link to a **Difficulty Parameter** and have a **Weight**.

**Example Mapping**:
- Model: ADDITION
- Difficulty: Year 2 (level "2")
- Format: DIRECT_CALCULATION
- Theme: SHOPPING
- Weight: 1.0

This means: "For Year 2 addition, we can generate direct calculation questions with shopping themes."

### Why Mappings Matter

Mappings control **what questions are possible**. Without a mapping:
- The system won't generate that combination
- Even if you have templates and characters, no questions appear

Think of mappings as "permission slips" - they tell the system:
"Yes, you're allowed to make ADDITION SHOPPING questions for Year 2."

### Viewing Mappings

The table shows:
- **Model** - Math operation
- **Difficulty** - Level and year in parentheses
- **Format** - Question type
- **Theme** - Story context
- **Weight** - Selection probability (0-10)
- **Status** - Active or Inactive

### Filtering

Three dropdown filters help you find mappings:
- **Model** - e.g., show only ADDITION
- **Format** - e.g., show only COMPARISON
- **Theme** - e.g., show only SHOPPING

Use combinations: "Show me all MULTIPLICATION SPORTS questions"

### Understanding Weight

Weight affects how often a mapping is chosen:
- **1.0** - Normal probability (default)
- **2.0** - Twice as likely to be selected
- **0.5** - Half as likely to be selected
- **10.0** - Very high priority
- **0.1** - Rarely selected

**Use Case**: You want more SHOPPING questions than NATURE questions for ADDITION. Give SHOPPING a weight of 2.0 and NATURE a weight of 0.5.

### Adding a Mapping Manually

1. Click **"Add Mapping"**
2. Fill in the form:

   **Model** (required)
   - Choose math operation

   **Difficulty Parameter** (required)
   - Dropdown shows parameters for your selected model
   - Shows level and year: "2 (Year 2)"
   - If empty: Create difficulty parameters first!

   **Format** (required)
   - Choose question type

   **Theme** (required)
   - Choose story context

   **Weight** (required)
   - Enter 0-10 (decimals allowed)
   - Default: 1.0

   **Active checkbox**
   - Checked = mapping is used

3. Click **"Create"**

**Common Error**: "No difficulty parameters found for ADDITION"
- **Solution**: Go to Difficulty Parameters page first
- Add parameters for that model
- Then return to create mappings

### Bulk Generate Mappings

Instead of creating mappings one by one, use bulk generation:

1. Click **"Bulk Generate"** button (top right)
2. Choose a **Model ID** (e.g., ADDITION)
3. Read the preview:
   - "Creates default mappings for all difficulty parameters"
   - "Uses DIRECT_CALCULATION format and SHOPPING theme"
   - "Weight set to 1.0"
   - "Skips existing mappings (no duplicates)"
4. Click **"Generate Mappings"**
5. Success message shows how many were created

**When to Use Bulk Generate**:
- Setting up a new math model
- You want standard SHOPPING questions for all difficulties
- Quick way to ensure every difficulty level has at least one mapping

**After Bulk Generate**:
- Edit individual mappings to change formats and themes
- Adjust weights based on your preferences
- Add additional mappings for variety

### Best Practices

**Coverage**:
- Each difficulty level should have at least 2-3 mappings
- Mix formats (not all DIRECT_CALCULATION)
- Mix themes (not all SHOPPING)

**Variety Example for Year 3 Addition**:
- Mapping 1: DIRECT_CALCULATION + SHOPPING (weight 2.0)
- Mapping 2: COMPARISON + POCKET_MONEY (weight 1.0)
- Mapping 3: VALIDATION + SCHOOL (weight 1.0)
- Mapping 4: MULTI_STEP + COOKING (weight 0.5)

This gives variety while favoring shopping scenarios.

**Testing**:
After creating mappings, go to **Generate Questions** and test:
- Generate 10-20 questions for that model
- Check if variety matches your expectations
- Adjust weights if needed

---

## Generate Questions

**Location**: `/admin/generate`

### What Is Question Generation?

This is where the magic happens! The system uses everything you've set up to create actual math questions.

### The Generation Form

At the top of the page, you'll see a form with settings:

**Model** (required)
- Choose which math operation
- Example: ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION

**Difficulty Level** (optional)
- Enter a specific level (e.g., "3.2") OR
- Leave blank for random difficulty

**Format Preference** (optional)
- Choose specific format (DIRECT_CALCULATION, COMPARISON, etc.) OR
- Leave as "Random" to let system choose

**Scenario Theme** (optional)
- Choose specific theme (SHOPPING, SCHOOL, etc.) OR
- Leave as "Random" to let system choose

**Number of Questions**
- How many to generate (1-20)
- Default: 1

**Save to Database** (checkbox)
- Checked = questions saved to database (recommended)
- Unchecked = preview only, not saved

**Auto-Approve** (checkbox)
- Only enabled if "Save to Database" is checked
- Checked = questions immediately approved (skip review)
- Unchecked = questions go to Approval Queue (recommended)

### Generating Questions

1. Configure your settings (or use defaults)
2. Click the blue **"Generate Questions"** button
3. Loading spinner appears: "Generating X question(s)..."
4. Results appear below

### Understanding the Results

Each generated question shows:

**Question Card** (one per question):
- Question number (Question 1, Question 2, etc.)
- Question ID (first 8 characters)
- Full question text
- Correct answer (green box)
- Distractors / wrong answers (red boxes)
- Reasoning explanation (blue box)
- Model, Difficulty, Format, Theme
- Full metadata (expandable JSON)

**Example Question**:
```
Question: Sarah has 5 apples and Jack gives her 3 more. How many apples does Sarah have now?

Correct Answer: 8

Distractors:
- 2 (subtraction error)
- 15 (multiplication error)
- 7 (counting error)

Reasoning: This is a simple addition problem. Start with 5, add 3, equals 8.

Model: ADDITION
Difficulty: 2
Format: DIRECT_CALCULATION
Theme: SHOPPING
```

### Action Buttons

After generation, you see:

**Export JSON**
- Downloads questions as JSON file
- Filename: `questions-{timestamp}.json`
- Use for importing into other systems

**Reset**
- Clears all generated questions
- Lets you start fresh

### Generation Tips

**Start Small**:
- Generate 1-2 questions first
- Check quality
- Adjust settings if needed
- Then generate more

**Testing Different Combinations**:
Try generating with:
- Different formats
- Different themes
- Different difficulty levels

This helps you understand what your data produces.

**Quality Issues**:
If questions seem wrong:
1. Check your difficulty parameters (are numbers reasonable?)
2. Check your templates (are placeholders correct?)
3. Check your mappings (do they exist for this combination?)

**Save vs. Auto-Approve**:
- During setup/testing: **Don't auto-approve**
- Review questions in Approval Queue first
- Once confident: **Auto-approve** for speed

---

## Approval Queue

**Location**: `/admin/approval-queue`

### What Is the Approval Queue?

This is where questions wait for review before being published. It's your quality control checkpoint.

The page shows how many questions are pending: "X questions pending approval"

### Viewing Questions

The table shows abbreviated information:
- **Checkbox** - Select for batch actions
- **Question** - Text truncated if long
- **Model** - Math operation
- **Difficulty** - Level
- **Format** - Question type

### Filtering Questions

Three dropdown filters at the top:
- **Model** - Show only ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, etc.
- **Format** - Show only DIRECT_CALCULATION, COMPARISON, etc.
- **Theme** - Show only SHOPPING, SCHOOL, etc.

Use filters to review similar questions together.

### Previewing a Question

### Workflow 2: Setting Up a New Math Model

**Goal**: Configure everything needed for MULTIPLICATION questions.

**Steps**:

**Step 1: Add Difficulty Parameters**
1. Go to **Difficulty Parameters** (`/admin/difficulty-parameters`)
2. For each year level (1-6), create a parameter:
   - Click "Add Parameter"
   - Model: MULTIPLICATION
   - Difficulty Level: "1", "2", "3", etc.
   - Year Level: 1, 2, 3, etc.
   - Parameters JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "multiplicand_min": 2,
       "multiplicand_max": 5,
       "multiplier_min": 2,
       "multiplier_max": 5
     }
     ```
   - Adjust ranges for each year
3. Create all 6 parameters (Year 1 through Year 6)

**Step 2: Create Mappings**
1. Go to **Curated Mappings** (`/admin/curated-mappings`)
2. Click **"Bulk Generate"**
3. Select Model: MULTIPLICATION
4. Click **"Generate Mappings"**
5. This creates basic mappings for all difficulty levels

**Step 3: Add Variety**
1. Still in Curated Mappings
2. Click "Add Mapping" manually several times
3. Create diverse combinations:
   - MULTIPLICATION + COMPARISON + SCHOOL
   - MULTIPLICATION + VALIDATION + SPORTS
   - MULTIPLICATION + MISSING_VALUE + SHOPPING
4. Set different weights (1.0, 2.0, 0.5) for variety

**Step 4: Test**
1. Go to **Generate Questions**
2. Model: MULTIPLICATION
3. Count: 10
4. Generate and review results
5. Check for variety in formats and themes

**Step 5: Refine**
Based on testing:
- Adjust difficulty parameters if questions are too easy/hard
- Add more mappings for missing format/theme combinations
- Adjust weights if variety is unbalanced

### Workflow 3: Bulk Reviewing Questions

**Goal**: Efficiently review 50 generated questions.

**Steps**:
1. Go to **Approval Queue**
2. **Filter by Model**: Select "ADDITION"
3. **Scan Table**: Look at questions
4. **Select Good Questions**:
   - Check boxes for obvious good ones
   - Skip any you're unsure about
5. **Batch Approve**: Click "Approve X" button
6. **Review Remaining One-by-One**:
   - Click eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) to preview
   - Approve (‚úì) or Reject (‚úó) each
7. **Change Filter**: Select "MULTIPLICATION"
8. Repeat steps 3-7
9. Continue until all models reviewed

**Time-Saving Tips**:
- Don't preview every question if patterns are obvious
- Batch approve similar questions
- Reject obviously bad ones immediately
- Take breaks to avoid fatigue/errors

### Workflow 4: Customizing Characters and Items

**Goal**: Add culturally relevant characters and items.

**Example: Adding Irish Cultural Elements**

**Characters**:
1. Go to **Characters** (`/admin/characters`)
2. Add Irish names:
   - Aoife (Female, Ireland)
   - Cian (Male, Ireland)
   - Saoirse (Female, Ireland)
   - Liam (Male, Ireland)
3. Set Cultural Context: "Ireland"

**Items**:
1. Go to **Items** (`/admin/items`)
2. Add Irish items:
   - Tayto Crisps (Food, ‚Ç¨1.00-‚Ç¨2.00)
   - GAA Jersey (Clothing, ‚Ç¨30-‚Ç¨60)
   - Irish Soda Bread (Food, ‚Ç¨2.50-‚Ç¨4.00)
3. Tag with appropriate themes

**Test**:
1. Generate questions
2. Verify Irish elements appear
3. Check if contexts feel appropriate

### Workflow 5: Adjusting Question Difficulty

**Goal**: Make Year 3 ADDITION harder.

**Current State**: Questions feel too easy.

**Steps**:
1. Go to **Difficulty Parameters**
2. Filter:
   - Model: ADDITION
   - Year Level: 3
3. Find the Year 3 parameter
4. Click pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit
5. View current JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "min": 1,
     "max": 20,
     "count": 2
   }
   ```
6. Increase difficulty:
   ```json
   {
     "min": 10,
     "max": 50,
     "count": 3
   }
   ```
7. Click "Update"
8. Test: Generate new Year 3 ADDITION questions
9. Review: Are they appropriately harder?
10. Adjust again if needed

## Tips & Best Practices

### Search Functionality

**Characters Page**:
- Search finds matches in name, gender, and cultural context
- Example: "UK" shows all UK characters
- Example: "female" shows all female characters

**Items Page**:
- Searches name, category, AND themes
- Example: "school" finds items tagged with SCHOOL theme
- Example: "food" finds items in Food category

**Pro Tip**: Use partial words. "shop" finds "SHOPPING", "shopkeeper", etc.

### Using Filters Effectively

**Combine Filters**:
Don't just use one filter - combine them!
- Difficulty Parameters: Model=ADDITION + Year=3
- Curated Mappings: Model=MULTIPLICATION + Format=COMPARISON + Theme=SPORTS

**Clear Filters**:
Reset filters by selecting "All Models", "All Years", etc.

### Understanding Table Counts

At bottom of most tables: "Showing X of Y records"
- X = Filtered results
- Y = Total records

If X < Y, you have filters active.

### Active vs. Inactive

Every entity has an Active/Inactive toggle:
- **Active** = Currently used by the system
- **Inactive** = Exists in database but not used

**Use Cases for Inactive**:
- Testing new items before making them live
- Temporarily removing problematic characters
- Seasonal items (make inactive when not relevant)

### JSON Editing

When editing parameters or metadata:
- Copy existing JSON as a starting point
- Validate syntax (editor shows errors)
- Test after changes
- Document what each field does (add comments in your notes)

### Backup Strategy

Before major changes:
1. Export current questions as JSON
2. Take note of current configuration
3. Make changes
4. If problems occur, you can restore

### Performance Tips

**Large Tables**:
- Use filters to reduce visible rows
- Search to find specific records
- Don't expand all JSON at once (use Expand All sparingly)

**Batch Operations**:
- Select reasonable batches (10-50 questions)
- Don't select 1000 questions at once
- Process in chunks for reliability

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1**: Creating mappings without difficulty parameters
- **Fix**: Always create difficulty parameters first

**Mistake 2**: No variety in mappings
- **Symptom**: All questions look the same
- **Fix**: Add mappings with different formats and themes

**Mistake 3**: Unrealistic prices for items
- **Symptom**: Questions about ¬£100 apples
- **Fix**: Research actual prices, set realistic ranges

**Mistake 4**: Auto-approving during testing
- **Symptom**: Database fills with bad questions
- **Fix**: Use approval queue until system is mature

**Mistake 5**: Not using weights
- **Symptom**: Unbalanced question distribution
- **Fix**: Adjust weights to favor desired combinations

**Mistake 6**: Inconsistent placeholder names
- **Symptom**: Templates don't work with scenarios
- **Fix**: Use standard placeholders: {character}, {item}, {price}

### Quality Checklist

Before approving questions, check:
- [ ] Math is correct
- [ ] Grammar is proper
- [ ] Context makes sense
- [ ] Difficulty matches level
- [ ] Distractors are plausible
- [ ] No awkward phrasing
- [ ] Appropriate for target age

### Getting Help

**Common Issues**:

**"No mappings found"**
- Go to Curated Mappings
- Create mappings for that model + difficulty

**"No templates found"**
- Go to Scenario Templates
- Create templates for that format + theme

**"Invalid JSON"**
- Check for missing commas
- Check for missing quotes
- Use online JSON validator

**"Questions too easy/hard"**
- Go to Difficulty Parameters
- Adjust min/max ranges
- Test again

**"Not enough variety"**
- Go to Curated Mappings
- Add more format/theme combinations
- Adjust weights
