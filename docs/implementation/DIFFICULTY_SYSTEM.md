# Factory Architect Enhanced Difficulty System
## Comprehensive Implementation Guide and Current Status

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Created:** September 6, 2025
**Last Updated:** Implementation in progress - API integration complete, 6 of 18 models enhanced
**Purpose:** Complete guide to the enhanced difficulty graduation system implementation

---

## Executive Summary

Factory Architect's enhanced difficulty system addresses critical difficulty gaps that create frustrating learning experiences. The original system had abrupt parameter jumps (up to 5x increases) that could damage student confidence. This implementation introduces a 4-level sub-difficulty system (X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4) to create smooth, confidence-preserving progressions.

**Key Issues Solved:**
- ADDITION: 5x max_value jump from Year 2 to Year 3 (20 → 100)
- SUBTRACTION: Simultaneous 5x increase + borrowing introduction
- MULTIPLICATION: 10x multiplicand increase (Year 3→4: 10 → 100)
- DIVISION: Binary remainder introduction with no gradual transition

**Solution Implemented:**
- 4 sub-levels per year creating 24 total difficulty levels (1.1 through 6.4)
- Maximum 50% parameter increases between adjacent sub-levels
- Confidence-based adaptive progression system
- Backward compatibility with existing integer year system

## Part 1: Enhanced Difficulty System Design

### Naming Convention and Philosophy

**Structure:**
- **Level X.1**: Entry/Warmup level (20% easier than current)
- **Level X.2**: Below Standard (10% easier than current)
- **Level X.3**: Standard/Expected (current default parameters)
- **Level X.4**: Advanced/Bridge level (prepares for next year)

**Smooth Progression Principle:**
- Maximum 50% increase in any single parameter between sub-levels
- No more than 2 parameters changing simultaneously
- Skills introduced gradually with practice opportunities

```typescript
// Existing integer year support continues
POST /api/generate {
  model_id: "ADDITION",
  year_level: 3,  // Still works - maps to 3.3
  difficulty_params: { /* optional overrides */ }
}

// New sub-level support added
POST /api/generate {

  year_level: 3.2,  // New decimal support
  adaptive_mode: true,
  confidence_mode: false
}
```

interface EnhancedGeneratedQuestion extends GeneratedQuestion {
  difficulty: {
    currentLevel: "3.2",
    cognitiveLoad: 70,
    nextRecommended: "3.3",
    nextAlternative: "3.1", // For struggling students
    skillsRequired: ["carrying", "3-digit addition"],
    newSkills: [] // Skills introduced at this level
  },

  }
}
```
