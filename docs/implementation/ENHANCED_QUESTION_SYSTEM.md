### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each cognitive format has its own controller
2. **Compositional Generation**: Questions are assembled from reusable parts
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Math Engine models remain unchanged
4. **Plugin Architecture**: New formats and scenarios can be added without core changes
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure predictable behavior

## 8 Question Formats (All Implemented ✅)

### 1. Direct Calculation ✅
**Purpose**: Traditional "What is X + Y?" questions

**Status**: Complete - All 25+ models supported

**Features**:
- Standard mathematical computation
- Enhanced distractors with common errors
- Working steps and explanations
- Full backward compatibility

**Example**:
```
Question: "Sarah goes to the shop and buys an apple for £12.00 and a
pen for £8.00. How much does Sarah spend in total?"

Answer: £20.00

Distractors (with strategies):
- £19.00 (CALCULATION_ERROR)
- £4.00 (WRONG_OPERATION - subtraction)
- £200.00 (PLACE_VALUE_ERROR)
```

### 2. Comparison ✅
**Purpose**: Compare values or quantities ("Which is better value?")

**Status**: Complete - UNIT_RATE, COMPARISON models

**Features**:
- Unit rate calculations
- "Better value" reasoning
- Visual comparison support
- Contextual decision-making

**Example**:
```
Question: "Pack A: 250g for £5.00. Pack B: 200g for £3.50.
Which is better value?"

Answer: Pack B is better value (£1.75 per 100g vs £2.00 per 100g)

Distractors:
- Pack A (REVERSED_COMPARISON - total price confusion)
- Both equal (WRONG_SELECTION - failed to calculate difference)
```

### 3. Estimation ✅
**Purpose**: Round or approximate results

**Status**: Complete - ADDITION, MULTIPLICATION, capacity, length

**Features**:
- Rounding to nearest 10, 100, 1000
- Magnitude-based benchmarks
- Real-world estimation contexts
- Multiple plausibility levels

**Example**:
```
Question: "A bottle holds about 475ml. Estimate its capacity."

Benchmarks:
- 1ml (a teaspoon)
- 250ml (a mug)  ✓ Closest
- 1000ml (a large bottle)
- 150,000ml (a bathtub)

Answer: About 250ml (a mug)
```

### 4. Validation ✅
**Purpose**: Check if calculation is correct ("Do you have enough?")

**Status**: Complete - ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, money models

**Features**:
- True/false verification
- "Check your work" questions
- Sufficient/insufficient scenarios
- Error spotting

**Example**:
```
Question: "Tom has £15. He wants to buy a book for £12 and a pen for £5.
Does he have enough money?"

Answer: No (needs £17, only has £15)

Explanation: £12 + £5 = £17, which is more than £15.
```

### 5. Multi-Step ✅
**Purpose**: Sequential problem solving (multiple calculations required)

**Status**: Complete with fallback handling

**Features**:
- 2-4 step problem sequences
- Progressive complexity by year
- Partial calculation distractors
- Order of operations awareness

**Example**:
```
Question: "Sarah has £50. She buys 3 books for £8 each. How much does
she have left?"

Steps:
1. Calculate cost of books: 3 × £8 = £24
2. Calculate remaining money: £50 - £24 = £26

Answer: £26

Distractors:
- £24 (PARTIAL_CALCULATION - stopped after step 1)
- £42 (WRONG_OPERATION - added instead of subtracted)
```

### 6. Missing Value ✅
**Purpose**: Find the unknown variable ("Find the missing number")

**Status**: Complete with fallback handling

**Features**:
- Algebraic thinking
- Fill-in-the-blank questions
- Variable isolation
- Simple equations

**Example**:
```
Question: "12 + ___ = 20. What is the missing number?"

Answer: 8

Distractors:
- 32 (WRONG_OPERATION - added instead of subtracted)
- 7 (CALCULATION_ERROR - off by one)
- 2.4 (PROCEDURAL_ERROR - divided incorrectly)
```

### 7. Ordering ✅
**Purpose**: Arrange in sequence ("Order from smallest to largest")

**Status**: Complete with fallback handling

**Features**:
- Ascending/descending sequences
- Numerical comparison
- Unit rate ordering
- Multiple values (3-5 items)

**Example**:
```
Question: "Order these amounts from smallest to largest:
£15.50, £8.20, £22.00, £12.30"

Answer: £8.20, £12.30, £15.50, £22.00

Distractors:
- £22.00, £15.50, £12.30, £8.20 (reversed order)
- £8.20, £15.50, £12.30, £22.00 (partially correct)
```

### 8. Pattern Recognition ✅
**Purpose**: Identify and extend patterns ("What comes next?")

**Status**: Complete with fallback handling

**Features**:
- Arithmetic sequences
- Geometric sequences
- Fibonacci patterns
- Quadratic patterns

**Example**:
```
Question: "What comes next in this sequence? 2, 5, 8, 11, ___"

Answer: 14 (adding 3 each time)

Distractors:
- 13 (CALCULATION_ERROR - off by one)
- 15 (PATTERN_ERROR - wrong increment)
- 22 (WRONG_OPERATION - doubled instead of added)
```

## Enhanced Services

### Distractor Engine (8 Strategies Implemented ✅)

#### Strategy 1: Wrong Operation
**Description**: Used wrong mathematical operation

**Example**: For 12 + 8 = 20, generate 12 - 8 = 4

**Applicability**: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION

**Recent Fix**: ✅ Floating point precision added (Math.round(x * 100) / 100)

#### Strategy 2: Place Value Error
**Description**: Carrying/borrowing mistakes

**Example**: For 47 + 38 = 85, generate 75 (forgot to carry)

**Applicability**: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION

**Recent Fix**: ✅ Floating point precision added

#### Strategy 3: Partial Calculation
**Description**: Stopped before completing all steps

**Example**: In multi-step "3 × £8 = £24, £50 - £24 = £26", generate £24

**Applicability**: MULTI_STEP, complex calculations

**Recent Fix**: ✅ Floating point precision added

#### Strategy 4: Unit Confusion
**Description**: Mixed up units or percentages

**Example**: For 10% of 100, generate 100 × 10 = 1000 (forgot to divide by 100)

**Applicability**: PERCENTAGE, UNIT_RATE

#### Strategy 5: Reversed Comparison
**Description**: Selected wrong option in comparison

**Example**: Selected option with lower total price instead of better unit price

**Applicability**: COMPARISON, UNIT_RATE

#### Strategy 6: Close Value
**Description**: Plausible nearby value

**Example**: For 20, generate 19 or 21

**Applicability**: All models

#### Strategy 7: Off by Magnitude
**Description**: Factor of 10 errors

**Example**: For 20, generate 200 or 2

**Applicability**: All models

**Recent Fix**: ✅ Magnitude distractor rounding added to estimation controller

#### Strategy 8: Common Misconception
**Description**: Library-based common errors

**Example**: For 0 × 5, generate 5 (zero property misconception)

**Applicability**: Model-specific from misconception library

## Recent Improvements (September 2025)

### Bug Fixes Implemented ✅

#### 1. Floating Point Precision ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Values like 24.369999999999997 appearing in options

**Solution**: Added `Math.round(value * 100) / 100` throughout:
- Distractor engine (3 locations)
- Estimation controller
- Missing value controller
- Orchestrator renderOptions method

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/distractor-engine.service.ts:299-320, 338-353, 774-779`
- `lib/controllers/estimation.controller.ts:566-603`
- `lib/controllers/missing-value.controller.ts:709-743`
- `lib/orchestrator/question-orchestrator.ts:1248-1275`

#### 2. Excessive Items in Question Text ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Liam goes to the shop and buys apple, banana, sandwich, drink..." (23 items)

**Solution**:
- Limited items to operand count (max 5) in direct-calculation controller
- Orchestrator doesn't overwrite if already set

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/controllers/direct-calculation.controller.ts:593-608`
- `lib/orchestrator/question-orchestrator.ts:1066-1086`

#### 3. Text/Value Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Option text "3.255" but value 3.26

**Solution**: Round values before generating text, use formatValue() for consistency

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/orchestrator/question-orchestrator.ts:1248-1275`

#### 4. API Parameter Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Curriculum tester using wrong parameters (mathModel, year, subLevel)

**Solution**: Updated to correct parameters (model_id, difficulty_level, context_type)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/curriculum-tester/page.tsx:121-131`

### Quality Improvements

1. **Placeholder Text Elimination**: 79 instances replaced with proper names
2. **"What is ?" Fix**: Incomplete questions resolved
3. **Non-numeric Answers**: All answers properly formatted
4. **Empty Scenarios**: Sports/cooking contexts fully populated
