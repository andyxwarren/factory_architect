## Interactive Mathematics Learning Platform

**Project Version:** 1.0  
**Document Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Project Scope:** Student-facing interactive mathematics learning interface  

---

## 📖 Executive Summary

### What We're Building (Non-Technical)

Factory Architect currently generates mathematical questions perfectly, but students can only see them as text. We're proposing to build an **interactive student interface** that makes answering these questions as easy as using a touchscreen phone or tablet.

**The Vision:**
- Students see engaging math problems (like "Sarah buys an apple for £2.50 and a pen for £1.20. How much does she spend?")
- Instead of writing answers on paper, they use **interactive tools** like:
  - Touch-friendly number buttons (like a calculator)
  - Drag-and-drop coin images to make money amounts
  - Large A/B/C buttons for multiple choice questions
  - Visual fraction builders and percentage sliders

**Why This Matters:**
- **Accessibility**: Makes math accessible to students with different learning needs
- **Engagement**: Interactive elements keep students focused and motivated
- **Immediate Feedback**: Students know instantly if they're right or wrong
- **Differentiation**: Automatic difficulty adjustment based on student performance
- **Data Insights**: Teachers can see exactly where students struggle

### What We're Building (Technical)

We're extending the existing Factory Architect system with a new **student-facing frontend** that:

1. **Consumes existing math engine output** - Reuses all 18 mathematical models
2. **Provides model-appropriate input interfaces** - Different UI components for different question types
3. **Validates answers programmatically** - Uses the math engine's structured output for instant checking
4. **Tracks student progress** - Session management and performance analytics
5. **Scales to classroom deployment** - Multi-student support with teacher oversight

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js components with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Extends existing API routes for session management
- **Data Flow**: Question generation → UI presentation → Answer validation → Progress tracking
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing curriculum mapping and model status systems

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Transform passive text questions into interactive experiences**
2. **Reduce cognitive load** by providing intuitive input methods
3. **Increase engagement** through visual feedback and gamification elements
4. **Provide immediate assessment** without teacher intervention
5. **Generate actionable data** about student understanding

### Success Metrics
- Students can answer questions 40% faster than traditional pen/paper
- 90% of students prefer the interactive interface over text-only questions  
- Teachers report more detailed insights into student understanding
- System handles 30+ concurrent students without performance issues

## 🧠 User Experience Design

### Student Journey (Non-Technical)

**Getting Started:**
1. Student opens the practice page on their device (tablet, laptop, or phone)
2. System shows them a friendly math problem in story format
3. Interactive tools appear based on the question type

**Answering Questions:**

**For Basic Math** (like 12 + 8):
- Large number buttons appear (like a calculator)
- Student taps numbers to build their answer
- Green checkmark when correct, gentle animation if incorrect

**For Money Questions** (like making £1.50 with coins):
- Visual coins appear on screen (1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2)
- Student drags coins into a "purse" area
- Running total shows as they add coins
- System celebrates when they reach the exact amount

**For Choice Questions** (like "Which is better value?"):
- Large A, B, C buttons with the options
- Visual comparisons (bars, charts) help students see differences
- One-tap selection with immediate feedback

**Progress and Motivation:**
- Progress bar shows completion through a set of questions
- Streak counter for consecutive correct answers
- Gentle encouragement and celebration animations
- Optional timer for self-challenge (not pressure)

### Teacher Experience (Non-Technical)

**Classroom Dashboard:**
- Real-time view of all student progress
- Quick identification of students who need help
- Insights into which question types cause the most difficulty
- Ability to adjust difficulty for individual students or the whole class

**Data Insights:**
- Which curriculum areas need more practice
- Common mistake patterns across the class
- Individual student growth over time
- Recommendations for targeted intervention

### Core Components

#### 1. Answer Input System

**Purpose**: Model-aware input components that adapt to question type

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
interface AnswerInputProps {
  questionData: GeneratedQuestion;
  onAnswer: (answer: StudentAnswer) => void;
  onValidate: (isCorrect: boolean, feedback: string) => void;
}

// Component automatically detects model type and renders appropriate interface
const AnswerInput: React.FC<AnswerInputProps> = ({ questionData }) => {
  switch(questionData.metadata.model_id) {
    case 'ADDITION':
    case 'SUBTRACTION':
    case 'MULTIPLICATION':
    case 'DIVISION':
      return <NumericInput />;
    case 'COIN_RECOGNITION':
    case 'COUNTING':
      return <CoinSelector />;
    case 'COMPARISON':
      return <MultipleChoice options={questionData.math_output.options} />;
    // ... other models
  }
};
```

#### 2. Answer Validation Service

**Purpose**: Programmatic answer checking using existing math engine output

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
class AnswerValidator {
  validate(studentAnswer: any, correctAnswer: any, modelId: string): ValidationResult {
    switch(modelId) {
      case 'ADDITION':
        return this.validateNumeric(studentAnswer, correctAnswer.result);
      case 'COUNTING':
        return this.validateCoinCombination(studentAnswer, correctAnswer.solutions);
      case 'COMPARISON':
        return this.validateSelection(studentAnswer, correctAnswer.winner_index);
      // ... specialized validation for each model
    }
  }

  private validateNumeric(student: number, correct: number): ValidationResult {
    const isExact = Math.abs(student - correct) < 0.01;
    const isClose = Math.abs(student - correct) < 0.1;
    
    return {
      isCorrect: isExact,
      feedback: isExact ? "Correct!" : isClose ? "Very close! Check your calculation." : "Try again.",
      partialCredit: isClose ? 0.8 : 0
    };
  }
}
