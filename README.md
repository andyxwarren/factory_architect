## Architecture Overview

### Core System (Established)
- **Math Engine**: Pure mathematical models that operate on numbers and logical parameters (25+ models)
- **Story Engine**: Contextual layer that wraps mathematical output with real-world scenarios

### Enhanced System (New)
- **Question Format Controllers**: 8 distinct cognitive question formats beyond basic calculation
- **Rich Scenario Service**: 10+ themed contexts with cultural awareness
- **Distractor Engine**: Pedagogically sound wrong answers based on common misconceptions
- **Orchestration Layer**: Intelligent format selection and question assembly

This dual architecture maintains complete backward compatibility while delivering advanced features for varied, engaging mathematical questions.

## Core Features

### Mathematical Foundation
- **25+ Atomic Mathematical Models**: Individual models for each operation (ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION, PERCENTAGE, UNIT_RATE, GEOMETRY, etc.)
- **Enhanced Difficulty System**: Sub-level progression (X.Y format) for precise control
- **Curriculum Compliance**: Aligned with UK National Curriculum Framework (Years 1-6)

### Enhanced Question Generation
- **8 Question Formats**:
  - Direct Calculation ("What is 25 + 17?")
  - Comparison ("Which is better value?")
  - Estimation ("Estimate the capacity")
  - Validation ("Do you have enough money?")
  - Multi-Step (Multiple calculations required)
  - Missing Value ("Find the missing number")
  - Ordering ("Order from smallest to largest")
  - Pattern Recognition ("What comes next?")

### Rich Contextual Scenarios
- **10+ Themed Contexts**: Shopping, School, Sports, Cooking, Pocket Money, Transport, Collections, Nature, Household, Celebrations
- **Cultural Awareness**: UK-specific currency, measurements, and cultural references
- **Dynamic Generation**: Procedural scenario creation based on year level and theme

### Pedagogical Enhancements
- **Smart Distractors**: 8 strategies for generating educationally meaningful wrong answers
- **Misconception Library**: Based on common student errors and cognitive patterns
- **Cognitive Load Tracking**: Difficulty scoring from 0-100 for adaptive learning

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **API Routes** for question generation and testing
- **Web Interface** for interactive model testing and parameter adjustment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd factory_architect

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the main dashboard.

### Testing Interface

Access the model testing interface at [http://localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) when running the development server. This provides:

#### Legacy Testing
- Interactive parameter controls for each mathematical model
- Real-time question generation and preview
- Batch testing with statistical analysis
- Export functionality for generated questions

#### Enhanced Testing
- Question format selection and testing
- Scenario theme preview and customization
- Distractor strategy analysis
- Cognitive load assessment
- Enhanced vs legacy comparison

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck # Run TypeScript type checking
npm run test     # Run tests (when implemented)
```

## API Endpoints

### Legacy Endpoint (Maintained)
```
POST /api/generate
```
Original question generation endpoint. Supports all 25+ math models with traditional difficulty parameters.

### Enhanced Endpoint (New)
```
POST /api/generate/enhanced
```
Advanced question generation with format selection, rich scenarios, and smart distractors.

**Example Enhanced Request:**
```json
{
  "model_id": "UNIT_RATE",
  "difficulty_level": "5.3",
  "format_preference": "COMPARISON",
  "scenario_theme": "SHOPPING",
  "pedagogical_focus": "reasoning",
  "quantity": 5
}
```

**Enhanced Response Features:**
- Multiple question formats
- Rich scenario contexts
- Pedagogical distractors
- Cognitive load metrics
- Curriculum alignment tags

### Documentation Endpoint
```
GET /api/generate/enhanced
```
Returns comprehensive API documentation and examples.

## Mathematical Models

The system implements **25+ atomic mathematical models** across multiple categories:

### Core Arithmetic
- **ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION** - Basic operations with enhanced difficulty progression
- **MULTI_STEP** - Sequential operation chains
- **LINEAR_EQUATION** - Function evaluation

### Advanced Mathematics
- **PERCENTAGE** - Percentage calculations and comparisons
- **UNIT_RATE** - Rate calculations and value comparisons
- **FRACTION** - Fractional arithmetic and relationships

### UK Money Models
- **COIN_RECOGNITION, CHANGE_CALCULATION** - Currency identification and transactions
- **MONEY_COMBINATIONS, MIXED_MONEY_UNITS** - Complex money operations
- **MONEY_FRACTIONS, MONEY_SCALING** - Proportional money reasoning

### Geometry Models
- **SHAPE_RECOGNITION, SHAPE_PROPERTIES** - 2D/3D shape analysis
- **ANGLE_MEASUREMENT, POSITION_DIRECTION** - Spatial reasoning
- **AREA_PERIMETER** - Measurement calculations

Each model includes:
