## üìä Mathematical Models Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented (6/18 models)
These models have complete 24-level progression tables (6 years √ó 4 sub-levels):

1. **ADDITION**
   - Smooth progression from single-digit sums to 4-digit carrying operations
   - Graduated introduction of carrying frequency and number ranges
   - Visual support flags for early learners

2. **SUBTRACTION**  
   - Progressive introduction of borrowing operations
   - Graduated number ranges from single-digit to 4-digit
   - Regrouping complexity controls

3. **MULTIPLICATION**
   - Times table progression from 2√ó, 5√ó, 10√ó basics to 12√ó mastery
   - Number range scaling from single-digit to large numbers
   - Conceptual support for understanding vs. memorization

4. **DIVISION**
   - Remainder handling from never to always
   - Division fact focus areas (related to times tables)
   - Visual representation support

5. **PERCENTAGE**
   - Simple percentages (10%, 50%) to complex calculations
   - Real-world context integration
   - Decimal percentage support

6. **FRACTION**
   - Unit fractions to improper fractions
   - Denominator complexity progression  
   - Visual fraction representation

### üöß Partially Implemented (0/18 models)
No models are in partial implementation state - they're either complete or not started.

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented (12/18 models)
These models still use the original harsh year-level jumps:

7. **COUNTING** - Basic counting and number recognition
8. **TIME_RATE** - Time calculations and rate problems  
9. **CONVERSION** - Unit conversions (metric/imperial)
10. **COMPARISON** - Number comparison and ordering
11. **MULTI_STEP** - Multi-operation word problems
12. **LINEAR_EQUATION** - Algebraic equations (y = mx + c)
13. **UNIT_RATE** - Rate calculations and proportions
14. **COIN_RECOGNITION** - Money identification skills
15. **CHANGE_CALCULATION** - Money change problems
16. **MONEY_COMBINATIONS** - Coin/note combinations
17. **MIXED_MONEY_UNITS** - Pounds and pence operations
18. **MONEY_FRACTIONS** - Fractional money amounts
19. **MONEY_SCALING** - Proportional money problems

## üìö UK National Curriculum Coverage Analysis

### Mathematical Strands Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Fully Enhanced Strands (2/9)
1. **Number - Addition and Subtraction**: Complete sub-level implementation
2. **Number - Multiplication and Division**: Complete sub-level implementation

3. **Number - Fractions**: FRACTION model enhanced, but decimal operations not addressed

#### ‚ùå Unenhanced Strands (6/9)
4. **Number - Place Value**: No sub-level implementation (COUNTING model not enhanced)
5. **Measurement**: No sub-level implementation (CONVERSION, TIME_RATE models not enhanced)
6. **Geometry - Properties of Shape**: No models exist yet
7. **Geometry - Position and Direction**: No models exist yet  
8. **Statistics**: No models exist yet
9. **Ratio and Proportion**: Partially covered by unenhanced UNIT_RATE model

### Substrand Coverage Summary
- **Total UK Curriculum Substrands**: 56
- **Addressed by Enhanced Models**: ~12 substrands (21%)
- **Addressed by Legacy Models**: ~28 substrands (50%) 
- **Not Addressed**: ~16 substrands (29%)

## üîß Technical Integration Points

### Session Management
