5. **MULTI_STEP**: Sequential problem solving
6. **MISSING_VALUE**: Find the unknown variable
7. **ORDERING**: Arrange in sequence
8. **PATTERN_RECOGNITION**: Identify and extend patterns

### 5. Intelligent Format Selection

#### Model-Specific Compatibility Matrix
Each mathematical model has specifically curated compatible formats:
- Basic arithmetic (ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV): Focus on calculation and word problems
- Advanced models (PERCENTAGE/FRACTION): Include estimation and validation
- Complex models (LINEAR_EQUATION): Pattern recognition and missing values

#### Year-Level Format Restrictions
Progressive format availability based on student year:
- **Year 1**: Direct calculation, comparison only
- **Year 2**: Add multi-step problems
- **Year 3**: Include missing value problems
- **Year 4**: Add estimation and ordering
- **Year 5**: Include validation
- **Year 6**: Full range including pattern recognition

### 6. Scenario System

#### Dynamic Themes

- **SPORTS**: Sports equipment and activities
- **COOKING**: Recipe and ingredient calculations
- **NATURE**: Outdoor and environmental contexts
- **TRANSPORT**: Travel and journey problems

#### Scenario Features
- Character name randomization (no placeholders)
- Context-appropriate pricing
- UK cultural elements (Â£, British shops)
- Year-appropriate complexity

### 7. Generation Tracking & Transparency

#### Generation Setup Tracking
Every question includes detailed generation metadata:
- Controller used (DirectCalculation, Estimation, etc.)
- Format selection reasoning
- Scenario theme and selection method
- Distractor strategies employed
- Performance metrics (generation time)
- Enhancement status (full/partial/fallback)

#### Export Capabilities
- **CSV Export**: Full generation setup in 15+ columns
- **JSON Export**: Complete structured data
- **Curriculum Manager UI**: Visual display of generation details

### 8. Robust Error Handling

#### Fallback Mechanisms
- Automatic fallback question generation if rendering fails
- Numeric answer validation (no "undefined" or "NaN")
- Placeholder text detection and replacement
- Template processing with multiple fallback patterns

#### Quality Assurance
- Question text validation (minimum length, no "What is ?")
- Answer format verification (always numeric for math)
- Scenario data population checks
- Controller output structure validation

### 9. Batch Generation

#### Capabilities
- Generate 1-20 questions per request
- Parallel generation for performance
- Format and theme variety options
- Success rate tracking
- Average generation time metrics

#### Configuration Options
- `quantity`: Number of questions (1-20)
- `formatVariety`: Enable diverse formats
- `themeVariety`: Rotate through scenarios
- `preferredFormats`: Specify allowed formats
- `preferredThemes`: Select specific contexts

### 10. API Endpoints
